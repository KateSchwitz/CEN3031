Front End:
The issues we planned to address were to display a working calendar and possibly the ability to add and remove events.
We were able to succesfully display a working calendar, but adding and removing events can only be done through the code.
We are still learning the basics of Angular, Typescript, and the Full Calendar library. We are also learning to make it look
better on the actual website.
